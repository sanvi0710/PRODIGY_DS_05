# PRODIGY_DS_05
# 🚧 Traffic Accident Analysis – Prodigy Infotech Task 05

## 📍 Internship Task – Prodigy Infotech

This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns related to:
- Road conditions
- Weather conditions
- Time of day

It also includes visualizations of accident hotspots and contributing factors using Python.

---

## 📁 Dataset Used

- **Name**: `RTA Dataset.csv`
- **Source**: Provided for internship analysis
- **Size**: Small (~1–2 MB), ideal for Colab
- **Key Columns**:
  - `Accident_severity`
  - `Road_surface_conditions`
  - `Weather_conditions`
  - `Light_conditions`
  - `Time` (hour extracted for time-based analysis)

---

## 🔍 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess traffic accident data
- Analyze trends based on environmental and temporal factors
- Visualize accident severity and hotspot indicators
- Create hourly and categorical accident distributions

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3**
- `Pandas` – Data manipulation
- `Seaborn` / `Matplotlib` – Visualizations
- `Folium` – Optional mapping (if lat/lon is available)

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- Accident Severity Count Plot
- Road Surface and Weather Condition Distributions
- Hourly and Time-of-Day Patterns
- Heatmaps (if coordinates are present)

---

## 📈 Insights Extracted

- Accidents are more frequent during specific hours of the day
- Road and weather conditions have a noticeable impact on accident severity
- Light conditions influence accident frequency during night/evening
- (Optional) Hotspots can be mapped using coordinates for urban planning

## 📌 How to Run

1. Open the `PRODIGY_INFOTECH_TASK_05.ipynb` notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload the dataset (`RTA Dataset.csv`) when prompted
3. Run the notebook cell by cell to see:
   - Preprocessing
   - Visualizations
   - Pattern analysiS
